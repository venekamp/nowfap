NowFap -  NOn Web Federated Authentication Portal
======

This project deploys COmanage using Ansible as a portal to handle
various non-web SSO scenarios. The portal needs an IdP for external
authentication. The IdP must adhere to the SAML 2.0 Web-SSO profile. The
ePPN is used to identify remote users and thus must be included in the
SAML response.

# Ansible playbooks and roles to install COmanage virtual machine.
This codebase contains all the roles/playbooks and templates to
configure a COmanage VMs.  The target Linux distribution for COmanage
server is Ubuntu Server 16.04. Target machines should have a user named 'ubuntu'
with sudo powers and the root user should have passwordless access to MySQL.

Machines are provisioned as follows:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i <local_inventory> comanage.yml
```

You are expected to provide your own inventory file as stated in the
above line. We will provide an example inventory file, so that you are
able to create your own. In the repository you'll find and example
inventory. See the `inventory` directory. The with this example
inventory, the above command will become:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/example/hosts comanage.yml
```

## Example inventory
The below inventory specifies the different hosts that need to be
provisioned in order to get a working system. There are four major
parts:

1. the portal itself;
2. an LDAP server;
3. SSH daemon capable of accessing the LDAP server for SSH key
   retrieval;
4. LDAP management (this component is not necessary, but can be
   convenient to have).

A typical host file would look like:
```ini
[portal]
portal.example.org  ansible_user=ansible

[ldap:children]
ldap-server
ssh-access

[ldap-server]
ldap.example.org ansible_user=ansible

[ssh-access]
ssh.example.org ansible_user=ansible

[phpldapadmin]
portal.example.org  ansible_user=ansible
```
The `ldap-server` and `ssh-access` hosts are placed in the same group,
as they share the IP address of the LDAP server.
server
Together with the above hosts file, `group_vars` are created as well.
Below an example of the group variables is given:

### Supported CAs for automatic certificate generation
The certificate roles is able to generate certificate having different
CAs as root.  Which CA must be used depends on the value of
`certficicate_ca`. The below table shows the supported CAs and the
corresponding value for `certificate_ca`.

| certificate_ca | Value       |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Self signed    | self-signed |
| Let's Encrypt  | letsencrypt |

### Example of group_vars
Inside the `group_vars` directory a number of group files can be found:

1. **portal.yml**
   ```yaml
   ---

   certificate_ca: "self-signed"
   certificate: /etc/ssl/certs/portal.example.org.pem
   certificate_key: /etc/ssl/private/portal.examaple.org.key

   sp_hostname: portal.example.org
   ```
2. **ldap.yml**
   ```yaml
   ---

   ldap_server: ldap://ldap.example.org
   ```
3. **ldap-server.yml**
   ```yaml
   ---

   ldap_admin: admin
   ldap_admin_passwd: BigSecret
   ldap_basedn: dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=org
   ldap_rootdn: "cn={{ ldap_admin }},{{ ldap_basedn }}"

   organisation: Example
   ```
4. **ssh-access.yml**
   ```yaml
   ---

   ldap_admin_passwd: BigSecret
   ldap_basedn: dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=org
   ```

Please note that in the above hosts and group_vars files examples,
private IP addresses were used as well as unsecure password and other
dummy strings for certificates and host name.

# Roles
The playbook executes the following roles:

| Role         | Description                                                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| apache       | The portal is build with Apache.                                                     |
| auth_mellon  | Install and configure an Apache module for external SAML Authentication.             |
| certificate  | Obtain or create a self signed certificate and install it.                           |
| comanage     | COmanage provides a portal in which the use case are implemented.                    |
| common       | A number of command task, like package installation.                                 |
| ldap         | LDAP is used to store attributes (ASP, OTP, SSH Pub key, etc) collected by COmanage. |
| mysql        | The framework requires a database.                                                   |
| php          | Php 5.6 is necessary for the underlying framework.                                   |
| phpldapadmin | Web interface to an LDAP instance.                                                   |
| sshd         | Setting up an SSH daemon that is able to retrieve SSH keys from an LDAP instance.    |
| surfconext   | Necessary metadata is fetched and verified in order to make the SAML flow work.      |

# Certificates
You typically need self signed certificates when you are deploying local
virtual machine. Usually, the configured network will be a NAT one and thus
the machines are typically not accessible from the outside. When deploying to
VMs that are reachable from the outside, you can use a trusted certificate
from Let's Encrypt.

The `certificate` role can either obtain a certificate through Let's Encrypt,
or create a self signed one. The certificate role tries to determine if the
supplied sp_hostname is resolvable. If it is, Let's Encrypt is used to
generate a valid certificate. If not, a self signed certificate is generated
instead.

## Certificate and key location
The name of the certificate is determined from the host and domain names.
However, the path to where the certificate and it private key can be found
must be specified. There are two variables that take care of this:
- certificate_path
- certificate_key_path

| Variable             | Default value     |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| certificate_path     | /etc/ssl/cert/    |
| certificate_key_path | /etc/ssl/private/ |

## Do not forget to specify parameters for mod_mellon
In order for mod_mellon to do the right thing, it needs to know a few
things first. You need to do this for each host, as these values are
unique to each one. Well, at least the sp_hostname is. So, please define
the following in your `portal.yml` group vars file:

| Variable    | Description                                            | Default value      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| sp_protocol | Protocol to be used                                    | https://           |
| sp_hostname | Name of the host where mod_mellon is being used        | portal.example.org |
| sp_path     | Path that follows the host name to create the full URI | 'registry/auth/sp' |

# Installing local VMs with Vagrant
In case you would like to do a quick setup of all components on your
local system, Vagrant can be used for that. The Vagrantfile contains all
the necessary configuration for a successful installation. The
Vagrantfile uses VirtualBox for the creation of the VMs, which are three
in total.

## Configuration
At the top of the Vagrantfile, you'll find a number of variables, which
you are free to change. Some of which should be changed. In the table
below, you'll find the names of these variables and a short description.

| Variable            | Change | Default value               | Description                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| comanage_version    |        | "2.0.0"                     | Which version to install                                                                                     |
| hostname_ports      |        | "portal"                    | hostname of the portal machine. There is no real need for changing it                                        |
| hostname_ldap       |        | "ldap"                      | hostname of the ldap machine. There is no real need for changing it                                          |
| hostname_ssh        |        | "ssh"                       | hostname of the ssh machine. There is no real need for changing it                                           |
| start_ip_address    |        | IPAddr.new('192.168.64.10') | Start IP address. The first VM gets assigned this address, the next ones get successor addresses             |
| domain              | Y      | "example.org"               | The domain name part. This really should be changed, as the EntityID is based on this and needs to be unique |
| given_name          | Y      | "John"                      | Your given name. The IdP likes to have a real name                                                           |
| surname             | Y      | "Doe"                       | Your surname. The IdP likes to have a real name                                                              |
| email               | Y      | "john.doe@example.org"      | Your email address. The IdP really like to be able to contact you in case there are issues                   |

| state               |        | "North-Holland"             | State or Province                                                                                            |
| locality            |        | "Amsterdam"                 | Locality or city                                                                                             |
| organisation        |        | "Example.org Ltd."          | Organisation name                                                                                            |
| organisation_unit   |        | "IT"                        | Department                                                                                                   |
| ssl_cert_days_valid |        | 365                         | Number of days you want the certificate to remain valid                                                      |
| ldap_admin          |        | "admin"                     | The admin name for LDAP                                                                                      |
| ldap_passwd         | Y      | "Please-change-me!"         | The password for the LDAP admin user                                                                         |

In the above table, you'll see a number of variables being marked as
'change'. Although the variables can be left at their default values --
you will get a valid installation -- you are strongly encouraged to
change them. Your IdP for example, expects you to provide real values.
For building trust it is best to give your real name and the IdP really
wants a real contact. That includes a valid email address. _Why not do it
now the way you are supposed to do it when doing it in real life?_ An
IdP needs those when there are issues and it needs to contact you.

The 'county', 'state', 'locality', 'organisation' and
'organisation_unit' are used for the generation of a self signed
certificate. You can leave them at their default values, but if you do
change them, your certificate will look much nicer.

Finally, you probably would want to change the 'ldap_passwd'. It always
good practice to change any given default passwords.

### Choosing a non Resolvable FQDN
The Ansible playbook will try to detect if the supplies host name and
domain name, i.e. the Fully Quantified Domain Name (FQDN), is resolvable
or not. If it is, Let's Encrypt will be used to get a valid certificate.
If you do not control this host, the certificate creation will fail and
hence the provisioning is aborted. To circumvent this, choose a domain
name that does not exists, or at the very least, choose a host name and
domain name combination that is unresolvable. If the fully qualified
domain name (FQDN) is unresolvable, a self signed certificate is created
instead.

## Creating and Provisioning of the VMs
As stated, the supplied Vagrantfile will create and provision three VMs:
'portal', 'ldap' and 'ssh'. The first VM, 'portal', is configured to
have 1GB of memory, the other two are configured with 512MB of memory.
To create and provision the three VMs execute the following command:
```
vagrant up
```

# Registering with an Identity Provider
Having successfully provisioned the target machines, whether or not you
are using local VMs, one last thing that is necessary is establishing a
trust relation with an Identity Provider (IdP). This trust is based on
the exchange of metadata. During the provisioning process, the metadata
of the IdP has already been imported and thereby anything the IdP sends
to you is trusted. However, the IdP cannot trust you yet. It does not
have _your_ metadata. The required metadata has already been created
during the provisioning process. All that needs to be done is send a copy
to the IdP.

## Getting your metadata
You can find the metadata at the following URL:
https://hostname.domainname/registry/auth/sp/metadata Alternatively, you
should also be able to find the metadata at:
`/etc/apache2/mellon/sp-metadata.xml` The easiest way to get your
metadata registered is giving the URL to the IdP. It can then download
the metadata itself. However, if you are using a local VM, the IP
address might be private and behind a NAT. In this case you must send
the metadata yourself and not the URL.
